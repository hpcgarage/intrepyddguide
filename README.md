# Welcome to Intrepydd!

Intrepydd is a novel ahead-of-time (AOT) programming system for Python
programmers who want faster code on current hardware, and also on
future reconfigurable and heterogeneous systems being designed to
address the challenges of post-Moore's-Law computing.
The target audience for Intrepydd is Python programmers who are
interested in writing
_data analytics kernels_ with the productivity of high-level Python
code and the
performance of low-level C/C++ code.  This web site summarizes an
early release (v0.2) of Intrepydd, finalized in
May 2019, and will be updated as later releases become available.
