The following code snippets show example uses of  data types in
function headers:
```
def inc(xs: Array(int32), val: int32):
    '''
    Increment every element in array `xs` by `val`
    '''
	. . .
def sum(xs: Array(float32)) -> float64:
    '''
    Add up all elements in array `xs` and return their sum
    '''	
```
