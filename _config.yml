title: Intrepydd Guide
description: This site contains documentation for v0.2 of the Intrepydd programming system being developed in the DDARING research project with contributors from Georgia Tech, UIUC, U.Michigan, and USC.  Intrepydd is a Python-based domain-specific programming language for data analytics kernels, suitable for ahead-of-time compilation on current and future hardware platforms and accelerators.  Intrepydd is not intended for writing complete/main programs.  This release (v0.2) contains an implementation of an early version of the Intrepydd language.  We welcome feedback from testers of this release; your feedback will influence future enhancements to the Intrepydd language, its implementation, and its documentation.
